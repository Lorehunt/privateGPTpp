        "summary": " The summary of the news is that there have been ongoing attacks in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine's military has been able to rebuff them. The warring sides have not been independently verified, and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has stated that everything is in their powers to continue fighting against Russia.\n",
        "article": "The Israel-Gaza war is \"taking away the focus\" from the conflict in Ukraine, the country's President Volodymyr Zelensky has admitted.He said this was \"one of the goals\" of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.And he denied that fighting in Ukraine had reached a stalemate, despite a recent assessment to this effect by the country's top military general.Ukraine's counter-offensive in the south has so far made little headway.This has prompted fears of war fatigue among Kyiv's Western allies, with suggestions of growing reluctance in some capitals to continue giving Ukraine advanced weapons and funds.Speaking at Saturday's briefing in Kyiv with visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Mr Zelensky said: \"It's clear that the war in the Middle East is taking away the focus\" from Ukraine.He said Russia wanted this focus to be \"weakened\", but stressed that \"everything is in our powers\".Mr Zelensky was also asked to comment on this week's assessment by Ukraine's chief military commander Valery Zaluzhny that the war was now moving to a \"positional\" or static stage, and this would benefit Moscow by \"allowing it to rebuild its military power\".\"Everyone is getting tired and there are different opinions,\" Mr Zelensky replied, adding: \"But this is not a stalemate.\"He admitted that Russia was \"controlling the skies\" and that Ukraine urgently needed US-made F-16 warplanes and advanced anti-aircraft defences to change the situation.The Ukrainian leader recalled that last year, there had also been a lot of talk about a stalemate on the vast battlefield in Ukraine - but he pointed to Kyiv's subsequent major military victories in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and Kherson in the south.Mr Zelensky also rejected media reports that he was coming under growing pressure to consider negotiations with Russia.\"Today, no-one among EU, US leaders and others - our partners - is putting pressure for us to now sit down to negotiate with Russia, and give away something to it. This will not happen.\"Moscow on Thursday also commented on Mr Zaluzhny's assessment, with Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman saying the current battlefield situation was not a \"stalemate\".\"All the [war] goals that were set must be achieved,\" Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Ukraine must realise that \"even talking about any prospects for the Kyiv regime's victory on the battlefield is absurd\".President Putin has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine's counter-offensive had failed, while his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said this week that Kyiv was losing the war despite supplies of new weapons from Nato allies.Meanwhile, the UK defence intelligence said in its latest report on Saturday that Russia \"has likely lost around 200 armoured vehicles during its assaults on the Donbas town of Avdiivka\" in eastern Ukraine.\"It is plausible that Russia has suffered several thousand personnel casualties around the town since the start of October 2023.\"Russia's leadership continues to demonstrate a willingness to accept heavy personnel losses for marginal territorial gains,\" the report said.Moscow has in recent weeks been trying to advance in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine - but Ukraine's military says all the attacks have been rebuffed.The claims by the two warring sides have not been independently verified.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "summary": " The government's plan to crack down on rough sleeping by criminalizing charities that provide shelter for homeless people has been met with criticism from opposition parties and charity groups. They argue that the policy will not address the root causes of homelessness and will only serve to further marginalize vulnerable individuals.",
        "article": "The home secretary is proposing new laws to restrict the use of tents by homeless people, arguing that many of them see it as a \"lifestyle choice\".Suella Braverman's plan would introduce new penalties in England and Wales for homeless people whom authorities believe have rejected offers of help.The plan was to stop \"those who cause nuisance... by pitching tents in public spaces,\" she said.Housing charity Shelter said: \"Nobody should be punished for being homeless\".The plan is expected to be included in the King's speech on Tuesday, which sets out the government's legislative agenda and is expected to focus heavily on law and order.Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Ms Braverman said: \"Nobody in Britain should be living in a tent on our streets. There are options for people who don't want to be sleeping rough.\"She said the government would always support those who are genuinely homeless, but added: \"We cannot allow our streets to be taken over by rows of tents occupied by people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice.\"She added: \"What I want to stop, and what the law-abiding majority wants us to stop, is those who cause nuisance and distress to other people by pitching tents in public spaces, aggressively begging, stealing, taking drugs, littering and blighting our communities.\"Unless action is taken, she said, \"British cities will go the way of places in the US like San Francisco and Los Angeles, where weak policies have led to an explosion of crime, drug taking and squalor.\"According to the Financial Times, the proposals are designed to replace elements of the 1824 Vagrancy Act.The paper reported that sources had said the plans being considered were for two clauses to be inserted in the new criminal justice bill, which applies to England and Wales. This would target tents that cause a nuisance - such as by obstructing shop doorways.According to the report, the proposals include creating a civil offence whereby charities could be fined for handing out tents if they were deemed to have caused a nuisance.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter said: \"Living on the streets is not a lifestyle choice.\"She added: \"Homelessness happens when housing policy fails and boils down to people not being able to afford to live anywhere.\"Private rents are at an all-time high, evictions are rising and the cost of living crisis continues.\"Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner added that the government should take responsibility for the housing crisis, rather than blame homeless people.\"A toxic mix of rising rents and a failure to end no-fault evictions are hitting vulnerable people, yet after years of delay the Tories still haven't kept their promises to act,\" she said.The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, said it was \"grim politics\" to \"criminalise homeless charities for simply trying to keep vulnerable people warm and dry in winter\".He added: \"This policy will do nothing to stop rough sleeping and will leave vulnerable people to face the harsh weather conditions without any shelter whatsoever.\"London mayor Sadiq Khan described the proposal as \"deeply depressing\".\"The government should be investing more in social housing, uplifting housing benefit rates and banning no-fault evictions,\" he wrote on X.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "summary": " The article discusses how Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's agenda may be impacted by various factors, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Covid inquiry. While Sunak may not have any new or revolutionary plans, he will likely face challenges in dealing with these issues.\n",
        "article": "Grab your trumpet! Polish the golden carriage! Dust down the throne! It's nearly time. Time for Charles III to make history, giving the first King's Speech in 70 years.Time for one of the country's finest ceremonial occasions, when a good chunk of all the King's horses and all the King's men trot from the Palace to Parliament before the monarch makes a speech to MPs, members of the House of Lords and all of us.Tuesday's speech will be one of those bizarrely British mashups of arcane tradition (10 points if you know what the Cap of Maintenance is) and modern politics.It's a big moment for a new monarch. And it's the last chance for a government in trouble to introduce a programme of new laws in the hope of shaking them out of the doldrums and grabbing your attention.New laws take a long time to go through Parliament. So while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak still has at least a year to try to turn things around before he must call an election, the speech is, insiders admit privately, more or less the last chance for the Conservatives to transform ideas into reality - if they want to get them on the statute book before we all go to the polls.But all the fancy regal fanfares in the world on Tuesday might be drowned out by bigger realities.Top of the list, the conflict in the Middle East. Whether it is the fraught practicalities of helping Brits get out of Gaza, or the diplomatic efforts to coax Israel to pause hostilities there, the conflict is naturally gobbling up political time and energy - and dominating the headlines. Although it is Labour leader Keir Starmer, not Rishi Sunak, who is facing more political pressure on the matter from many within his own ranks.Next, days of evidence at the Covid inquiry are confirming, in ever-more gruesome detail, just how grim the atmosphere was at the top of government during the pandemic.And much more important than Dominic Cummings' habit of inventing ever more vile swear words, evidence this week suggested that in a moment of profound national emergency, our government just could not cope.Memories of those agonising months have been stirred. We have seen in black and white, from messages between senior officials, that the notion of spreading the virus - \"herd immunity\" like chicken pox - was indeed part of the initial approach that was subsequently denied. And the civil service boss of the Department for Health said, on the record, that the first lockdown was a week too late. Remember just how bitter the political arguments were about the timing of the lockdown, and whether herd immunity had ever been the plan.The Covid evidence this week is important for the simple reason that the inquiry is trying to build a complete record of what happened during those months of emergency. But the daily drip of claims hampers Rishi Sunak's ability to move on.He was the second most senior minister in the government that struggled so badly, described by one of its most senior civil servants as a \"terrible, tragic, joke\". His \"Eat Out to Help Out\" scheme, it has already emerged, was branded \"Eat out to help the virus\" by government medics.The prime minister consistently tries to present himself to the public as a clean break from several years of chaos. But the inquiry's reminders of the problems of the pandemic, and the political failures, dredge up memories of all that.Even without those two huge blocks in his political path, is Mr Sunak planning to seize Tuesday as a day of radical action anyway?Erm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no.Insiders caution against expecting any shiny new ideas or revolutionary plans. You can read a primer on what might be coming up here.Some cabinet ministers worry it is all a bit \"managerial\", all a bit \"tinkering\", not really talking to the problems millions of voters are facing right now.The AI summit, and Rishi Sunak's encounter with tech billionaire Elon Musk, complete with dropped consonants and a mid-Atlantic twang, showed that No 10 can generate attention - it can make things happen.But whether that is translated into an energetic and packed actual programme to get things done on Tuesday? Don't be so sure.While a senior source says the King's Speech is a \"chance to reset the dynamic\", don't expect big surprises to make that happen.You will see laws coming to bring in changes on sentencing that were announced at party conference last month.You will also likely see a new law on oil and gas licences that will try to set a trap for Labour. It is one of those strange things in politics where sometimes a government will introduce a law that isn't necessarily needed, but will just make life awkward for their opponents. There are divisions in the Labour Party over whether or not new licences should be granted for fossil fuel exploration. If the Tories make them vote on it, that could be politically tricky for Keir Starmer.So on Tuesday, the biggest fanfare may be from the real trumpets that will sound in Parliament, not political excitement.The ongoing conflict in the Middle East, and last week's revelations from the Covid inquiry, both make it harder for the government to be heard.But this coming week, a coming reminder of perhaps Rishi Sunak's biggest obstacle. Like any prime minister, he has to deal with \"events\" beyond his control that can knock any leader off course. The real nightmare though, is how to escape from under the weight of what has gone wrong under Conservative PMs who have gone before.As King, Tuesday will be Charles's first outing in that grandest of ceremonies in Parliament. Without a dramatic turn for Rishi Sunak, this King's Speech could be this PM's last.PS: The \"Cap of Maintenance\" is a red velvet hat, lined with ermine, that is one of the Royal Family's insignia. It's normally carried by the leader of the House of Lords on these big days as part of the procession.If you got that right, 10 points and your prize, along with everyone else, is to watch the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden in the studio with me tomorrow morning at 09:00 on BBC One, along with our other guests and a special interview with the Succession star, Sarah Snook.Follow Laura on Twitter\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "article": "Tens of thousands of protesters have joined rallies and sit-ins in dozens of towns and cities across the UK to call for an end to Israeli attacks in Gaza.The Met Police estimate there were 30,000 in central London alone.At Edinburgh and Glasgow rail stations, and at London's Charing Cross, people sat on the floor stopping travellers from catching trains, police said.In London, 11 people were arrested - including one for displaying a placard that could incite hatred, the Met said.It said the individual was being held under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which makes it an offence to express support for a proscribed organisation.Two more were held for a public order offence and assaulting a police officer, the force added. No details were given about the other eight arrests.Pro-Palestinian protests have been held in London, and other cities globally, each Saturday since war began last month.One of the protest organisers, Stop the War coalition, said this weekend would see a series of local protests organised in neighbourhoods, town and cities across the UK, rather than a mass rally.In London, local protests took place before many thousands of demonstrators packed into Trafalgar Square for a rally, led by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign.Protesters brought traffic to a temporary standstill in London's Oxford Street with a sit-in.Later the Metropolitan Police reported fireworks were fired into crowds and towards its officers in Trafalgar Square. Police needed a dispersal order to clear the area.Thousands more gathered in Manchester.Earlier in the northern city, the North West Friends of Israel group held a vigil for the hostages taken in the Hamas attacks on 7 October.Red heart-shaped balloons were attached to each of the hostages' names and photos in Manchester's Exchange Square.Other pro-Palestinian rallies also took place in Belfast, Cardiff, Liverpool and Leeds, with a focus on calling for an immediate ceasefire.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday there would be no temporary ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza until all Israeli hostages were released.In contrast to this weekend's smaller-scale protests, there are plans for a mass rally next Saturday on Armistice Day which have been criticised by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as \"provocative and disrespectful\".He pointed to a risk that war memorials, including the Cenotaph in central London, could be \"desecrated\".Home Secretary Suella Braverman said on X, formerly Twitter, that it was \"entirely unacceptable to desecrate Armistice Day with a hate march through London\".On Remembrance Sunday, which this year falls on 12 November, thousands of servicemen and women usually march past the Cenotaph as senior politicians and royals lay poppy wreaths to remember the fallen.London's Metropolitan Police said it was planning a \"significant\" policing and security operation for next weekend.Both the Met and the march's organisers say the demonstrators have no intention of going near Whitehall, where the Cenotaph is located.Ben Jamal, director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said all of their protests had been peaceful and orderly, and to suggest that another one - well away from Whitehall - \"was a disrespect to the war dead was an insult to those marching for peace\".Israel has been bombarding Gaza with prolonged air strikes following the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, in which they killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israeli air strikes have killed more than 9,000 people. Hamas is a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK.Protests in London have been largely peaceful, although 99 people were arrested at the three previous massive weekly marches in London.BBC reporters, who witnessed the demonstrations, said a wide range of people from different backgrounds, including lots of families with children, have attended the marches.Writing in the Times however, Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the line between protesters supporting innocent Palestinians and backing Hamas have become \"badly blurred\".\"Those lines have remained blurred in the subsequent demonstrations, in which a minority have proudly displayed their extremism on their banners and in their chants, while the majority stand alongside them,\" he wrote.On Friday, five people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at London's King's Cross station after the demonstration was banned.Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he had given an order to allow police to stop the protest.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Jajarkot's hospital is packed with the wounded.Some people have had to be airlifted as far as Kathmandu, but officials are worried about getting others out after nightfall.One survivor, Geethakumari Bista, told the BBC that rescuers saved her elder daughter, but she lost her younger daughter.\"We three were in the same room on the top floor. Everything happened so suddenly. We couldn't understand what was happening,\" she recalled.After their house collapsed, they were buried in the rubble.\"People shouted around. The armed police came and I shouted: 'I am alive, too'... First, they rescued my elder daughter by carrying her out and taking her downstairs. Unfortunately, they couldn't save my younger one. She was 14 years old.\"Three more tremors were felt within an hour of the quake. Local authorities urged people to stay outside for at least 24 hours as minor aftershocks are being reported in the areas.Video footage on local media showed crumbled facades of multi-storied brick houses. People were pictured digging through rubble in the dark to pull survivors from the remains of collapsed buildings in posts on social media.Unicef Nepal said that they were assessing the damage and the toll of the disaster on children and families.Nepal's Prime Minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, arrived in the affected region on Saturday, after expressing his \"deep sorrow\" at the loss of life and property wrought by the quake, on social media platform X. He said he had ordered security agencies to immediately launch rescue and relief operations.A cabinet meeting on Sunday is expected to decide whether to accept foreign assistance for relief and rescue. Officials said many countries, including Nepal's neighbours China and India, had offered humanitarian help.Search and rescue operations are being hampered by roads becoming blocked by landslides that were triggered by the quake.\"Houses have collapsed. People rushed out of their homes. I am out in the crowd of terrified residents,\" said a police official from the region, Santosh Rokka, who spoke to Reuters immediately after the earthquake.\"We were sleeping. We felt like dying,\" says Laxman Pun, an earthquake survivor. Their house has been damaged and they could survive \"with much difficulty\", he told BBC Nepali. \"We don't know where we will be able to stay. We will probably need tents.\"\"Our house shook back and forth like a swing. As we rushed outside, there were houses falling and dust everywhere. We couldn't see anything and so we again moved inside. We came out after the tremors stopped,\" said Siddha Bohora, a bank manager from Jajarkot.In Athaviskot municipality, one of the areas worst affected by the earthquake, three people who had critical injuries were sent to hospitals in Surkhet by an army helicopter for further treatment.Municipality chief Ravi KC warned that because of the cold weather, the victims who lost their houses will \"suffer more\". The municipality has a population of about 35,000 and hundreds of houses were completely damaged, according to KC.Local government officials, police and army have been deployed for rescue operations, as there are still bodies left to be recovered from the rubble.The earthquake was recorded at 23:47 local time (18:02 GMT), according to Nepal's Monitoring and Research Centre.The US Geological Survey measured the earthquake at a magnitude of 5.6 and said it was a shallow earthquake, meaning it happened closer to the earth's surface.Nepal is situated along the Himalayas, where there is a lot of seismic activity.Last month, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake was registered in the western district of Bajhang, resulting in injuries.In 2015, the country suffered two devastating earthquakes in which 9,000 people were killed and 22,309 injured.The first, on 25 April 2015, was a 7.8-magnitude quake which caused most of the damage and loss of life. A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 in May of that year.The quakes destroyed or damaged more than 800,000 houses mainly in the western and central districts, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).Government buildings, some stretches of roads and Kathmandu Valley's famous historic monuments - Unesco world heritage sites - were destroyed or damaged, with many villages north of Kathmandu flattened.With additional reporting from BBC Nepali\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

They plan to shear her overgrown fleece and hand her over to a farm park.The rescue mission was organised by Cammy Wilson, a sheep shearer from Ayrshire, after seeing media coverage of the ewe's plight.Mr Wilson, who is a presenter on the BBC's Landward programme, organised the rescue in a personal capacity along with four others.Speaking in a video posted on Facebook, he said: \"We've come up here with some heavy equipment and we've got this sheep up an incredibly steep slope.\"She's in incredible condition. She is about a condition score of about 4.5, she is overfat - it was some job lifting her up that slope.\"She is going to a very special place that a lot of you know very well, where you'll be able to see her virtually every day.\"Mr Wilson later told BBC News he became determined to rescue the sheep after reading unfair comments about the farmer whose flock she came from.He said the farmer had made previous attempts to retrieve her but was unable to do so without putting himself or his employees in danger.He said: \"I just hated seeing the misinformation online, the comments from people not in the know about 'farmers don't care.'\"People were starting to show up on his land and it wasn't fair.\"He said he anticipated some people would criticise his rescue mission as foolhardy, and he accepted it was risky.\"The only difference between us being heroes and idiots is a slip of the foot,\" he said.\"I would do it again, maybe not tomorrow though because I'm knackered.\"He was joined in the rescue by fellow farmers Graeme Parker, Als Couzens, Ally Williamson and James Parker.Two of them stayed at the top to operate a winch while three others were lowered 250m (820ft) down the cliff to reach Fiona.They found her in a cave.The Scottish SPCA said it had been aware of the ewe being stranded at the bottom of the cliff for some time but was unable to find a safe way to rescue her.A spokesperson for the charity said: \"This morning the Scottish SPCA were in attendance at the hillside after they were made aware that a group of individuals with climbing expertise were attempting to rescue the stranded sheep by descending down to where she was trapped.\"The team brought the ewe up successfully and our inspector examined her.\"Thankfully the sheep is in good bodily condition, aside from needing to be sheared. She will now be taken to a specialist home within Scotland to rest and recover.\"Mr Wilson said Fiona would receive a much-needed groom in the coming days.The sheep made national headlines after a kayaker took a photograph and shared concerns about her welfare.Jill Turner, from Brora, told the Northern Times she first came across the ewe while kayaking in 2021.She was shocked to discover she was still there two years later, and pleaded for someone to rescue her.A petition calling for a rescue operation has gathered more than 52,000 signatures.The full story of the rescue will be told on the BBC's Landward programme, due to broadcast on the BBC Scotland channel on 16 November and BBC One Scotland the following day.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

We're showing you the median wages, which is how much the middle-ranking employee earns.To calculate the annual change in real terms, we adjusted April 2022 earnings to what they would have been in April 2023 if workers received pay rises in line with inflation, or more precisely, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH). The difference between the recorded April 2023 wages and the inflation-adjusted estimates is the annual change in real terms.For the job group titles, we used the latest ONS classification of occupations, which groups related jobs together.

        "summary": " Drumsheds is a new nightclub in London that has been repurposed from an old industrial space. It has already proven to be a boost to the city's nightlife and could potentially face demolition in the next few years due to temporary planning permission.",
        "article": "For many of those who go to London's new 15,000-capacity superclub Drumsheds, it won't be the first time they've stepped inside the huge building.That's because the Tottenham warehouse used to house Ikea's UK flagship store.The Swedish furniture-maker closed this branch in 2022, leaving behind a 608,000 sq ft (56,485m sq) space.Now, its familiar aisles and showrooms have been replaced by panoramic screens, high-quality sound systems and immersive light displays in three rooms that can accommodate all types of dance music.As you walk in for the first time, it's hard to wipe memories of what the space used to look like - the main entrance hall has been created from the space that used to house Ikea's bits and bobs like crockery and bedding.It's somewhere I've marked a few milestones, including the big trolley dash before moving to university to get kitchen essentials, and again a couple of years ago when I moved into my own place for the very first time.Others shares the same thoughts - a woman in front of me marvels at how the old caf\u00c3\u00a9 has been turned into a huge bar, serving beers and cocktails rather than meatballs and hot dogs.For this particular event, the venue has been decked out by Spanish electronic dance company Elrow for Halloween.The main 9,000-capacity room - which used to be the superstore's flat pack warehouse - is decorated with pumpkins, ghouls and every other spooky stereotype.Hosting so many people in one space was never going to be without problems. A one-way system put in to help people get in and out of rooms was described to me as \"very annoying\" and \"pretty confusing\" by friends Jay and Cameron, who I met in a long, static queue for the smallest, 1,000-capacity room.It's also been pouring with rain all day and nowhere outside is covered - something Harry describes as \"not good\" as his chips turn soggy during the downpour.This seems a bit of an oversight considering the club operates a lot of day parties and isn't open in the summer months so it doesn't compete with festival season.Rach, who is in the drop-off area trying to order a cab, says on first impressions \"it definitely brought back some memories of visiting Ikea\".\"I loved that each room had a completely different feel,\" she adds. \"It could take a little while to get into each of the rooms because of the layout but crowds moved quickly.\"The sound system was super clear, especially in the smaller rooms and the bars were easily accessible from each room.\"Visiting a new clubbing space doesn't happen often in this current climate. UK nightlife has been in decline for 15 years and this week, for the first time since records began 30 years ago, the number of venues serving alcohol dropped below 100,000.Like with most venues in their opening weeks, there are teething problems. But Drumsheds doesn't feel too big to succeed - having space to move on the dancefloor is welcome in a post-pandemic world where we're all a little less comfortable with being crammed in to tight spaces.It also fills a gap left by the closure of operator Broadwick Live's previous venue - Printworks - by recreating an industrial, warehouse environment and filling it with the biggest names in dance music.Much like Printworks, an old printing press that closed earlier this year to make room for a new office development, Drumsheds only has temporary planning permission and could make way for housing or office space in the next few years.Broadwick co-founder Simeon Aldred told the BBC earlier this year that night-time spaces were under huge threat in urban areas, with his company facing \"massive challenges\".\"One of the things post-pandemic is that people have been living in silence, local communities have become very quiet places,\" he said.\"So around licensing and planning, there's challenges and inconsistencies - you've got some councils that are really pro-culture and some that are less so.\"After the pandemic, there's also a concern that business rates could increase significantly in 2024 if inflation fails to fall. That, coupled with an end to government relief scheme, could mean more closures across the hospitality industry.Aldred said Broadwick's operating costs across its 26 UK venues \"have gone up by millions\" and that trying to keep a hospitality company going amid the numerous challenges \"has been really, really difficult\".The creation of Drumsheds was facilitated by Amy Lam\u00c3\u00a9, who has been night czar to the mayor of London since 2016.She tells the BBC it is already \"proving a real boost to our city\".\"Our world-renowned nightlife is integral to our economic and social recovery and Drumsheds is a great example of how we can repurpose spaces to bring people together,\" she says.\"I am proud to have supported the venue and will continue to do all I can to champion and support the industry as we build a better London for all.\"Whether or not Drumsheds gets the chance to establish itself as a night time destination, for now it provides a haven for those who want to spend their weekends on the dancefloor rather than shopping in a Swedish superstore.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "summary": " The film How to Have Sex explores themes of sexual assault and consent through a narrative set in Malia. The director, Manning Walker, has stated that she drew inspiration from her own formative memory of witnessing a man being sexually assaulted on stage during a bar crawl as a teenager. The film aims to engage with real-life issues and has included workshops where the cast discussed consent with 16-year-olds. The director emphasizes that sexual assault can happen anywhere, not just on hedonistic group trips abroad, and wants men to recognize themselves in the characters and take responsibility for their actions.\n\n",
        "article": "Sexual consent and the \"gap in understanding\" about what sexual assault actually means is the subject of Molly Manning Walker's visceral debut feature film, How to Have Sex.It is fair to say the rising star of British cinema has not taken the easy route.The 30-year-old, who trained as a cinematographer, both wrote and directed her debut, which follows three female teens who excitedly head to a party town in Crete to celebrate the end of their GCSEs.But while the exuberance of youth is gloriously celebrated in the bars and clubs of Malia, there is a dark underbelly to this tale of self-discovery as the trio navigate sex and consent.Warning: themes of a sexual nature and discussion of sexual assault discussed below.Persuasion actress Mia McKenna-Bruce takes the leading role as Tara, who is self-conscious about still being a virgin and finds herself in uncharted territory on a night out.Manning Walker says the idea for the story came from a \"formative memory\" she has of seeing a man being given oral sex on stage during a bar crawl on a holiday she went on as a teenager.\"I started writing from there. We spent a bit of time in Malia doing research. We really tried to... engage with real life and what was going on. And then we did some workshops where we talked to 16-year-olds and their concept of consent, and it was quite wild what came out of that.\"Without giving too much away, Tara finds herself in two dangerous situations with one of the lads from the group staying in the apartment next door.\"For me, every woman I know has been sexually assaulted and not every man I know would claim to have had that experience or to have been a perpetrator. So I think there's a real gap there in what people understand as assault,\" says Manning Walker.\"And I think that's where we have to open the conversation up to allow men and women to discuss what's going on.\"The film focuses on not just the perpetrator, Paddy (Samuel Bottomley), but also his mate, Badger (Shaun Thomas) who develops a genuine friendship with Tara.Manning Walker said: \"It was really important that we don't lock men out of the conversation. I wanted men to recognise themselves in the characters and although Badger is really fun...and sweet, he fails her [Tara] and he doesn't stand up at the right moment.\"He kind of enables his mate to continue the behaviour. And I think that's [what] we're trying to talk about ... don't assault people, that should be obvious. But... let's talk about stuff with our friends, let's care for other people. Let's make kindness more forefront in our lives.\"While the film tackles a serious subject, it's certainly not all bleak.The film has some powerful shifts in tone, with switch-ups between light and dark, fun and fear, pure joy and intense despair.Carefree moments are often quickly tempered with a growing tension that builds to a crescendo.Manning Walker explains: \"We designed the film in two halves. The first half is meant to be like this fun girls' holiday, escapism, light and airy.\"And then there's the second half. The camera style changes. Everything's dirty or more [expletive] up and the intensity of the performances... everyone feels it. The base [music] gets deeper and darker, the crickets actually get louder and faster in the background. And this intensity just keeps going throughout the film.\"The director is keen to point out that while Malia is a vehicle for the movie's narrative, sexual assault can obviously happen anywhere, not just on hedonistic group trips abroad.\"I don't want to put too much blame on these holidays because I had some of the best times of my life [on these types of trips]. These kind of things happen in all circumstances like in London in clubs, or when you go camping, or at music festivals. It happens wherever.\"The complexity of playing the role of Tara, who goes through so many mixed emotions and is fundamentally changed by the film's conclusion, was a challenge McKenna-Bruce relished.She modestly stresses that her authentic performance was down to the camaraderie of the close-knit team of cast and crew, fostered by Manning Walker.\"It's 100% down to Molly and the cast. We all connected on a really, really deep level. The set in itself was super-supportive, super-safe from the get-go.\"As is common practice in the modern-day film industry, the production employed an intimacy co-ordinator, who protects and guides actors filming intimate scenes.\"It was the first time I've worked with an intimacy co-ordinator, which is insane,\" McKenna-Bruce tells me.\"To me, it's crazy to think that you wouldn't have intimacy co-ordinators in the same way that you'd have stunt co-ordinators. You wouldn't expect someone to do a fight without a stunt co-ordinator. We choreographed everything to a tee.\"The film also tackles toxic female friendship and peer pressure, with Tara's friend Skye (Lara Peake) often putting her down and making fun of her lack of sexual experience.\"I didn't want it to be just coming from the men. I wanted it to come from all angles,\" says Manning Walker.\"We get to see those glimpses with Skye, like her mum not being present,\" says McKenna-Bruce.\"It's projection and you allow yourself to take these jabs from people for their benefit. And that's something that you don't have to do.\"While secondary schools do teach consent as part of the RSHE curriculum, Manning Walker thinks more could be done.\"It's so binary, so law-based and for me, I'm like, 'you have to stop thinking \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the police are going to protect us'.\"We're trying to get a sex education situation going, we really want to take it [the film] into schools,\" she adds.She said: \"We've had amazing experiences, like an older man watched it and said that he realised that he'd been Paddy, and also young people saying thank you for making something that makes us feel so seen.\"The Schools Consent Project sends lawyers into schools to teach consent to 11 to 18-year-olds.Founder Kate Parker told the BBC: \"Films like How to Have Sex are essential in bringing these conversations to a wider audience.\"Consent can often be seen as a clunky legal term; these sorts of films reframe it in a disarmingly relatable way. They encourage their audiences to really scrutinise what consent looks and feels like, what a violation is, how to articulate that, and what to do when other factors are involved: alcohol, drugs, peer pressure, etc.\"Daniel Guinness of Beyond Equality, a charity that helps boys and men rethink masculinity to empower them, says:\"It's important for men to understand that they also have the right and the ability to give their consent or not give their consent to things.\"And it's [also] important for men and boys, because at the moment, they are the ones who are perpetrating more of the sexual violence. It's really important they're very aware about the need for them to be checking in with any partner that they have.\"And while controversial influencers such as Andrew Tate have arguably made conversations around consent more difficult for young people, McKenna-Ball is glad women's voices are being heard.\"I think with voices like Molly's in the industry, that in itself is moving forward. I feel like this didn't exist for me growing up. So the fact that it does now is a step in the right direction.\"Obviously [there's] a lot further to go... as much as there's a lot that's still very, very hard to deal with and frustrating, there is movement and there is light at the end of the tunnel.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this story you can find help and support at BBC Action Line.Additional reporting by Rebecca Swash.How to Have Sex is in cinemas across the UK.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

The individual wrote a blog about their living conditions while trapped in the refugee camp, and they have now been accepted for permanent residency in Canada.",
        "article": "In November 2019, the BBC reported on Shams Erfan, a 21-year-old Afghan who fled the Taliban, alone, as a teenager. We met him in Indonesia, where he was stuck in a refugee camp - one of millions worldwide with only a tiny chance of starting a new life. Four years later, he writes his own story.On the afternoon of 8 November 2021, I sat on the cement stairs inside the International Ferry Terminal in the city of Batam, Indonesia. It was a three-minute walk from the refugee shelter where I lived; an escape from the camp's small, dark and windowless rooms.Two cargo ships were parked on the other side of the terminal promenade. I watched the men unloading sacks of rice and flour from the ship. The warm salty water, breaking against the cement wall of the promenade, splashed on my face.With nowhere to go, I found another bench, at the east end of the terminal, under the shade of a coconut tree. I could see the ferries full of tourists leaving Batam for Singapore, just across the water. I became lost in imagination, dreaming of freedom.Soon, I had to return to the shelter's small, cramped rooms, to meet the 6pm curfew. To distract myself, I opened my phone. There was an email.It was from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).I had been in Indonesia since fleeing Afghanistan in December 2014, aged 15. Back then, on a trip to Kabul to pick up supplies for the English-language school where I worked, Taliban gunmen hijacked my bus, looking to kill the \"English teacher\".As the gunmen slapped my face, a stranger saved my life. But even then, I knew: I had to leave Afghanistan. I fled to Delhi, then Kuala Lumpur, before taking a wooden boat across the Strait of Malacca. After bouncing around various sites in Indonesia, in 2016 I found myself in Pontianak, a prison camp for asylum seekers.Resettlement rates from Indonesia to third countries, via the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), were low. The chances of receiving an individual resettlement offer were almost non-existent. Certainty seemed elusive.In prison, I wrote a blog about the living conditions of refugees, like me, who were trapped. My audience was small but supportive. One evening in 2018, as the last rays of the sun disappeared behind the razor wire-topped walls, and a dark, unwelcome cloud obscured the blue skies, I got a message from Canada.It was from Renee Oettershagen, a lady from Burlington, Ontario. Renee had read my work and we had become friends. I connected her with friends in Australia - Denise, Lindy, Diana, and Jane - who were also eager to help me escape Indonesia. They had read my work and wanted me to live somewhere as a normal citizen, with full rights, rather than the in-limbo, locked-up life of an asylum seeker.Our team discovered that I was eligible to apply for permanent residency in Canada through the Group of Five programme. Under this programme, groups of Canadians living in one community could form a group to sponsor a refugee, so long as they were already recognised by the UNHCR, which I was.To begin the paperwork, we needed 16,500 Canadian dollars (\u00c2\u00a39,825) held in a bank account, allocated for my first year's living expenses in Canada. It was a daunting sum, and raising it seemed impossible.That evening, as I walked in circles on the prison's dirt ground, Renee messaged me with incredible news. She and her husband, Bill, had agreed to welcome me into one of their empty bedrooms in their house.As I burst into laughter, amazed that these Australians and Canadians had opened their hearts and homes, the security guard yelled at me to return to my cell.Despite the guard's anger, half my problem was resolved - we now only needed 8,000 CAD. The other half of the funds was raised between my Australian friends, and we needed three more Canadians to join the team the Group of Five.Another woman, Wendy Noury Long, became aware of my story. She joined the team with her husband and son, and we submitted my application to the government of Canada in January 2020.Almost two years later, I sat at the Batam ferry terminal and read the email from the IOM.\"We have scheduled your flight to move to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, to complete your medical examination and biometric process at the Canadian embassy, in order to leave Indonesia for Canada.\"In order to leave Indonesia for Canada.I read the email five times. Maybe he sent it by mistake? I washed my face in the terminal's bathroom with cold water, then took a long, deep breath.I turned on my internet and read the email again. It was for me. I saw my name. It was real.I'm leaving. My application for permanent residency in Canada was accepted.The news flowed through my veins like a morning breeze, propelling my body to run towards the shelter to meet the curfew. Arriving five minutes late would mean being sent to solitary confinement.A local man, who had a few packs of instant coffee and noodles on his cart, was sitting on a portable red plastic chair outside the terminal gate. He had taken off his shirt and was using it to dry the sweat dripping from his forehead.As I walked past, he called me \"Orang Migran\" - a refugee man. The words echoed in my ears, like congratulations for surviving eight years of life in detention. I felt lighter. The trees lined up on both side of the roads, gently rustling, celebrating the news with me.The next day, I went to Jakarta. I completed my medical examination at a hospital, and two months later, completed my biometrics at the Canadian embassy.It still felt surreal. While in the embassy, I could almost smell Canada.My flight to Canada was scheduled for 3 March 2022. As the IOM dropped me off at the airport in Jakarta, I couldn't believe I was there, waiting for my flight to take off.In my hand, I held the travel document and ticket issued by the Canadian government. I kept looking at them, doubting their authenticity. At the same time, my eyes continued to scan every corner of the waiting room, looking for immigration officers who might order me back to the refugee shelter.Finally, the call for the flight came. Unlike the camps, there was no immigration officer to accompany me. When I needed to use the restroom, I went alone. When I wanted a cup of tea, the number wasn't monitored.We finally landed at Istanbul Airport where I waited, tired and red-eyed, for the connecting flight to Canada. But I couldn't sleep.The night before, the IOM said they would pick me up at midday. I couldn't settle, fearing the immigration guards would find an excuse to cancel my flight if I were late.Now - despite being awake for 30 hours - I still couldn't risk napping on the bench and missing my flight to Canada. So I stayed awake, my dry eyes blinking, my excitement rising.Finally, I boarded the plane. The screen on the back of the seat showed our location. As the plane flew over Europe and got farther away from Indonesia, my dream of seeing something - anything - outside Indonesia since 2014 was coming true.As the plane began its descent, almost everyone seemed calm, their expressions revealing no sign of excitement or happiness. I was different.The snowy landscape of Toronto came into view. My heart beat faster. Finally, it was my turn to disembark. The passengers walking alongside me to the terminal blew on their hands to keep them warm. The mother who sat next to me on the plane took off her jacket and wrapped it around her child's body.My coat, which was considered warm in Indonesia, did nothing to keep out the cold. But right then, I didn't notice it. The excitement of arriving in Canada overcame any of that.Walking toward the airport terminal, I realised, again, there were no guards accompanying me. In the past eight years in Indonesia, every time I was transferred from one detention centre to another, there were always at least 10 guards monitoring my every move. Now I was free.I walked alone through the airport gate to meet my sponsors, who were holding a sign that read: \"Welcome Shams\".Outside it was still cold, but the welcome made my body glow. My sponsors had only met me online. To them, I was a stranger.During my eight-year imprisonment in Indonesian prison camps, I blogged anonymously about the refugees' living conditions, hoping to bring our plight to the world's attention. To be safe, I had to use a pen name.But that night, everyone called me by my own name. I was no longer invisible. I was no longer a label; an \"illegal\"; a number. I'd escaped the Taliban's attempt to kill me, only to endure eight years imprisonment in Indonesia. At last, thanks to my sponsors and their friends, I was free.Shams Erfan, 25, is a permanent resident in Canada and will take the Canadian citizenship test in 18 months' time. He is a writer-in-residence at the George Brown College in Toronto and studies at the University of Toronto, with plans to become a human rights and immigration lawyer.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Senior civil servants and cabinet ministers' foul-mouthed WhatsApp messages, diaries of concerned scientists, and scribbled recordings of meetings are being made public to give insight into what was happening in Downing Street at the time. The culture in the building is described as \"macho\" and \"sexist,\" with concerns that women were being ignored.\n",
        "article": "Three years ago on Sunday, the government brought in a second lockdown in England. People were told again to stay at home to protect the health service and save lives.Covid will, for some, feel like a distant memory. For others, it will bring back painful recollections of isolation and lost loved ones.Part of the Covid Inquiry's job is to find out how key decisions were made.The evidence we have seen at the hearings this week has been remarkable.Sitting in the press room at the inquiry in London - there was at times an overwhelming list of claims about what was going on at the heart of government, as we all grappled with the virus.To recap a few: \"Downing Street was in chaos\"; \"There was no plan for a Coronavirus response\", and \"It took too long for the first lockdown to be introduced\".Others include: Mr Johnson was \"weak and indecisive\" and \"often changed his mind\"; the prime minister apparently questioned shutting down the economy to save people who were going to \"die anyway\"; and \"Health Secretary Matt Hancock said things which turned out to be untrue\".The list goes on.It was claimed the atmosphere in No 10 was 'toxic and sexist'. Dominic Cummings, the PM's most powerful adviser, used the most vulgar language to refer to his colleagues and government ministers.This video can not be playedDominic Cummings on his 2020 messages about Downing Street's handling of Covid: \"My appalling language was obviously my own\"These are claims from key individuals. Some - like Mr Cummings - have made it clear how much they despise Mr Johnson. Others will give evidence before the end of the year and they may well have different recollections.But we are learning a lot about what Downing Street was like at the time in the eyes of people working there. And the picture isn't pretty.WhatsApp messages make it clear that the key players were bitterly divided and arguing with itself. Mr Cummings was scathing about some of the people who worked in Whitehall and furious about what was going on behind the scenes. Partly in response, senior civil servants were concerned that the environment was \"macho\" and \"sexist\". They were raising fears about a misogynist culture, and concerns that women were being ignored.That tells us about the culture in the most powerful building in the country. But it also paints a picture of senior advisers who didn't trust each other, didn't agree and sometimes didn't even talk - just as the biggest crisis in decades was unfolding. When the machinery of government needed to be pulling together to respond to Covid - it was perhaps as divided as it has ever been.What impact did that have?It's suggested that the macho culture led to overconfidence in the early stages of the pandemic - which senior civil servant Helen MacNamara describes as a \"de facto\" assumption that \"we were going to be great\".This video can not be playedA day after Dominic Cummings is challenged about some emails about a colleague in No 10 from 2020, she gives her reaction..She also argued forcefully that the interests of key groups like women, ethnic minorities and disadvantaged people were being ignored because they weren't represented in high-level discussions.None of this gives the impression of a government working effectively. But the problems appear to go deeper.Did the government have a proper plan for responding to the pandemic? We've known for a while that the UK's planning had been based on a flu-like viral outbreak, rather than other illnesses such as Covid.Different aides have said Mr Hancock insisted there was a plan. But many have also concluded that there wasn't. Ms MacNamara delivered a damning conclusion when she agreed that the former health secretary would often say things which turned out to be untrue. Mr Hancock will have his chance to defend himself against those claims in a few weeks.The actions of the prime minister were of course crucial too. We've heard multiple key aides claim Mr Johnson was indecisive, took too long to make decisions and often veered between very different positions.We've seen notes saying the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, believed Mr Johnson agreed with MPs who thought Covid was nature's way of dealing with older people.Sir Patrick, whose job it was to advise Johnson on matters of life and death, found him to be \"weak and indecisive\".Incredibly, Mr Cummings told the inquiry he didn't think it was worth including the prime minister in discussions about Covid in February 2020 - because he would just get in the way.For Mr Johnson's critics - this will confirm some of their worst fears; that he was the wrong man for the job. At the very least, it tells us that senior people around him had serious concerns.Mr Johnson will deliver his defence before Christmas. But we've seen snippets of his witness statement, in which he argues any responsible leader would debate the pros and cons of lockdown. \"We simply had no good choices, and it was necessary at all times to weigh up the harms that any choice would cause\", he argues.Stand back from it all a bit.We've heard some of these stories before. It's not a surprise that Mr Cummings didn't rate senior ministers and civil servants - he isn't shy about saying so. The divisions and tensions in No 10 were widely reported at the time. Many have consistently argued that Mr Johnson was the wrong man at the wrong time.But the stark picture painted at this week's hearings - of a dysfunctional, divided and chaotic No 10 - is a timely reminder of the events of 2020.The detailed and contemporaneous communications, foul-mouthed WhatsApp messages, diaries of concerned scientists and scribbled recordings of meetings involving cabinet ministers will bring back memories of those surreal, grim days of crisis - and help us discover a little more about what was going on in Downing Street.It may be the only time we see such unfiltered communications revealed in full - many in Westminster have turned on the \"disappearing messages\" function on WhatsApp in recent months.That doesn't mean there won't be a lot more to come before next year, however, with senior ministers getting set to give their version of events in the coming weeks.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

According to Dr Angharad Rudkin, a clinical psychologist, this phenomenon is caused by heightened awareness and confirmation bias, where people's minds are wired to respond to potential threats. Dr Abigael San, a cognitive therapist, explains that the itching sensation is related to imagery and the brain's response to meaningful stimuli. The article highlights how this experience can be more challenging for individuals with anxiety disorders.",
        "article": "Just the mere mention of bed bugs can make your your skin crawl.Panic over the pesky pests has swept across Europe over the past couple of months, following reports of soaring infestations.Although their bites can cause itchiness, bedbugs do not usually cause other physical health problems in humans.However, it is the effect on one's mental health that can be most damaging - leaving some who have had infestations with anxiety, flashbacks and insomnia.Why do some of us itch when we're just thinking and reading about bed bugs- even if we've never had an infestation?It's all to do with the mind-body connection, says Dr Heather Sequeira, a clinical psychologist who specialises in anxiety and obsessional behaviours.\"Our brain has this remarkable ability to make associations between specific thoughts or mental images and physical sensations,\" she says.\"When you think about bedbugs, your brain may activate memories or mental images associated with the discomfort of getting bitten by an insect and initiate neural patterns associated with heightened awareness, leading to increased skin sensations.\"Psychogenic itching - how psychologists describe an itch which has no dermatological or systemic cause - is a very common phenomenon.But, Dr Sequeira says, the more you fear or feel disgusted by bedbugs, the more likely you are to experience it.\"By saying we all have psychogenic itching to some degree, we normalise it,\" she adds.\"If we are scared, anxious, or grossed out by something, our body goes on high alert to detect that potential 'threat'.\"Similarly, if we are experiencing anxiety and stress for different reasons, we are also more likely to have a stronger reaction to thinking about bedbugs\".Dr Sequeira says she has had more patients telling her about their bedbug-related anxieties over the past couple of months - which she attributes in part to \"heightened awareness\" resulting from the increased media coverage.There have been recent reported infestations in Paris and other French cities, and a library in west London closed temporarily after the insects were discovered in the furnishings.Dr Angharad Rudkin, a clinical psychologist who specialises in anxiety and intrusive thoughts, says for people whose \"threat alert system\" is already high, reading about recent outbreaks confirms in their minds that it could soon become a reality for them too.\"[They think] 'It has happened in Paris and it could happen to me',\" she says.Dr Rudkin also says the experience is very normal but is worse for people who have anxiety disorders.\"All of us are getting that slightly itchy feeling,\" she says.\"Depending on your mental health, if you are feeling quite relaxed it will not be more than a passing thought, but if catches you when you are stressed or tired it can get a bit stickier.\"The problem can be compounded at the thought of your bedroom no longer being a place of safety.\"Finding a spider in your bed is far worse than finding it in a bathroom,\" Dr Rudkin says.One school of thought which explains why some of us react in this way is our survival instincts, Dr Rudkin explains.\"The people who were a little bit on edge and had their threat alert on high were the ones who survived,\" she says.\"We are the descendants of worriers, so our bodies are wired to respond in this way.\"Dr Abigael San, who specialises in cognitive therapy, says the itching sensation is about imagery.\"When the image of something is really meaningful for you, especially if it carries threatening information, your brain is doing the same thing as if it was really there,\" she says.\"It's not just bedbugs, looking at a spider will give you that sensation of feeling like a spider is crawling on you - you know it's not there but the sensation is there.\"For a lot of people who are scared of bugs, just conjuring up an image can feel really, really scary.\"The part of your brain dealing with fear and threat will light up in the same way as if the physical thing was in front of you.\"Dr San has worked with a patient who she says was \"traumatised\" by her experience with bedbugs.\"She was not someone who had a fear of bugs before, for her it was the trauma that it carried,\" she says.\"The trauma was about other stuff - the pest control person, her feeling blamed.\"For her, looking at an image of bedbugs will provoke feelings of anger and shame.\"How are bedbugs affecting your life?

        "summary": " The article discusses how Australia is trying to balance its relationship with China amidst tensions between the two countries. Australia wants to maintain a good relationship with China while also diversifying away from them and restricting their capital flows into the country. This move is aimed at wooing Canberra away from Washington, particularly in gaining Australian support for entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). However, this could risk landing both countries back at square one.\n\n",
        "article": "China and Australia are proof that governments do not have to like each other to do business.When Anthony Albanese arrives in China on Saturday, he will be the first Australian prime minister to visit in seven years.His three-day trip comes in the wake of plummeting relations between the two countries - and Canberra's growing military ties with Washington.In recent years Australia and China have accused each other over human rights violations and perceived threats to national security. Public perceptions of the other side are more negative than they have ever been.But when it comes to trade, they cannot afford to let go of each other. At the peak of their trading relationship in 2020, almost half of Australia's exports went to China.By way of comparison, at around the same time roughly 9% of all US exports and only 5% of British exports were being sold to China.This kind of leverage can be a powerful tool if a government wants to make a point, which is what happened in 2020 when Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.\"That was deeply upsetting to the Chinese government,\" said Jane Golley, an economist at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.\"Shortly after, the [Chinese] ambassador here gave a speech and suggested that some Australian industries might suffer as a consequence.\"Sure enough, a string of Chinese tariffs and restrictions followed on an estimated $20bn (\u00c2\u00a316.4bn) worth of Australian goods. Among the many products affected were barley, beef, wine, coal, timber and lobster.\"Basically the Chinese government was sending a message. They were unhappy with the Australian government and decided to use economic coercion to make that point,\" Professor Golley added.At the time, such a robust move from an important trading partner was a surprise to many. Since then, China has reversed many of the restrictions.The decision to row back on the tariffs was, at least partly, helped by a change of tack from the newly elected Australian government.Shortly after meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali last year, Mr Albanese said: \"We're always going to be better off when we have dialogue and are able to talk constructively and respectfully\".He reminded Australians that trade with China was worth more than with Japan, the US and South Korea combined. Clearly, normalising relations between what he called \"two highly complementary economies\" would be a priority for his government.Whether China's so-called economic coercion was successful is doubtful. Australia is still openly critical of Beijing on several fronts - but there is no question that Australian businesses and workers took a hit because of China's trade restrictions.\"We can't live without them, essentially,\" Professor Golley said. \"I think the Albanese government clearly decided that our economic links were too important to sacrifice and went for an improvement in our diplomacy.\"Australia has its own levers it can use to its advantage - especially when it comes to natural resources.\"China and Australia are deeply economically interdependent,\" said Benjamin Herscovitch, a research fellow at the ANU's National Security College.Typically, China has been, and still is, highly reliant on Australia for raw materials to satisfy its vast and growing economy.Huge amounts of its iron ore and liquefied natural gas, for example, come from Australia. Incidentally, neither of these commodities were subjected to Chinese restrictions.The Chinese public can live without Australian wine and lobsters, but until the country is able to adequately source materials to make steel or power its factories, Beijing knows it is not in a strong position to start making demands of Australia.Some analysts argue that China's trade restrictions were not forcing Canberra closer to Beijing - rather they had the opposite effect.\"The Chinese government started to realise that its coercive economic and diplomatic measures were driving Australia closer to the United States,\" said Mr Herscovitch.\"Beijing's decision to remove trade restrictions and normalise diplomatic contact is aimed at wooing Canberra away from Washington.\"One aim could be to gain Australian support for entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).This is the successor to the doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - the free trade agreement from which then-US President Donald Trump withdrew. So far several countries, including Australia, have blocked China's attempts to join.\"To be blunt, China doesn't have that many friends in the world. We used to be one, but not anymore,\" Professor Golley said. \"If you think about it, it makes sense to have a strong economic relationship with an ally of the United States. If you're being cynical, it gives you an opportunity to drive a wedge between us and Washington.\"Given the heightened tensions with the US, it makes sense that China does not want to alienate America's allies.Not only is Washington trying to exclude China from access to technology needed for advanced computer chips and critical minerals needed for green energy, it is also putting pressure on its allies to do the same.Half of the world's lithium, for example, is in Australia. Chinese companies want access to such metals that are crucial for making electric vehicles, a field in which China is currently the global leader.According to Professor Golley, there is a danger that Australia and China become \"competitors rather than collaborators\" when it comes to issues they need to work together on, such as fighting climate change.Australia's close political and military ties with the US mean it will inevitably fall on the American side of the superpower struggle.But siding with a country whose economic policies actively harm China will only put more strain on the relationship and could risk landing both countries back at square one.\"I don't know how much longer this can continue\", said Professor Golley. \"The Australian government wants a relationship with China in which, basically, we continue to export to them as normal.\"\"But at the same time we also diversify away from them and restrict their capital flows into the country. To me, that sounds like we want to have our cake and eat it too.\"\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.",

        "article": "Imagine you could go back in time 4.6 billion years and take a picture of our Sun just as it was being born. What would it look like?Well, you can get a clue from this glorious new image acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).Towards the centre of this object, called HH212, is a star coming into existence that is probably no more than 50,000 years old.The scene would have looked much the same when our Sun was a similar age.You can't actually see the glow from the protostar itself because it's hidden within a dense, spinning disc of gas and dust.All you get are the pinky-red jets that it's shooting out in polar opposite directions.HH212 is sited in Orion, close to the three brilliant stars that make up the \"belt\" of the mythical hunter that gives the constellation its name. The distance from Earth is about 1,300 light-years.Physics suggests those dramatic outflows of gas are the means by which the nascent star regulates its birthing.\"As the blobby ball of gas at the centre compacts down, it rotates. But if it rotates too fast, it will fly apart, so something has to get rid of the angular momentum,\" explained Prof Mark McCaughrean.\"We think it's jets and outflows. We think that as all the material shrinks down, magnetic fields are pulled together and then some of the material coming in through the disc gets captured on magnetic fields and is thrown out through the poles. That's why we call these structures bi-polar,\" the European Space Agency senior scientific advisor told BBC News.The pinky-red colour denotes the presence of molecular hydrogen. That's two hydrogen atoms bonded together (rather like the \"HH\" in the protostar's name). Shockwaves are moving through the outflows, energising them and making them glow brightly in this Webb picture, which was captured predominantly at the infrared wavelength of 2.12 microns (that's the second part of the protostar's name!).The image of HH212 was acquired by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). You can't see the protostar itself because it's obscured by a dense, infalling disc of gas and dust. There are a few mature stars in the field of view, but most of the points of light are far-distant galaxies.In the annotated picture above, look closely at the left and right jets, and trace the knots of brightness in each of them. Count the bowshocks - where faster material has crashed into slower material just ahead of it.The structures are remarkably symmetric... except there appears to be an additional, albeit very messy bowshock on the right.In fact, there's probably a complementary bowshock on the other side. There are certainly pinky hints of it in a wider version of this Webb image. It's just that the density of gas and dust in space in that direction is thinner and so there's less material to excite and so the shock structure appears much more diffuse.Astronomers have been studying HH212 for 30 years, taking pictures every now and then to see how it's changed. As you might expect from the Webb super telescope, its new view is 10 times sharper than anything we've had before and will enable scientists to delve deeper into the processes that drive star formation.A nice feature is to run together the entire image history to make a movie, to see how elements in the jet structures change over time. Repeat observations mean you can also gauge the speed at which those elements are moving - at 100km per second and more.This video can not be playedWatch: See how the structure of HH212 has changed since being viewed in 2000I've kind of suggested the HH stands for molecular hydrogen, and it's a neat fit. But it really stands for Herbig-Haro, after George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, who did the pioneering work on this type of object in the 1940s and 50s.They would no doubt be amazed by the capabilities of JWST. It's not just the sharpness of image that Webb can achieve with its 6.5m primary mirror, it's also the breadth of colour its instruments can now detect that makes the telescope so special.\"As we said, the main wavelength for looking at these things - for looking at shocked molecular hydrogen - is 2.12 microns, or roughly four times longer than the mid-visible. But for the first time, we now have a good colour image of this particular object because we're able to observe it at other wavelengths that you just couldn't see from ground telescopes. And that will help us get into what's really happening in the jets,\" said Prof McCaughrean.Webb was intended to be transformative in many fields of astronomy, and the study of Herbig-Haro objects has definitely benefitted.Look below and you can marvel at HH212's cousin, called HH211. This object, located in the Perseus constellation, is even younger, again measured in mere thousands of years. To think our Sun started out like this.JWST is a joint venture between the US, European and Canadian space agencies.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Societies often keep their effigies a surprise until the day.Past effigies have included Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Vladimir Putin and broadcaster Katie Hopkins.Another tableau this year shows Chancellor Jeremy Hunt driving a train with HS2 on the side.

        "article": "After the release this week of what has been billed as the last ever Beatles song, a Halifax woman tells how the Fab Four secretly stayed in her family home after a show 59 years ago.\"Every teenager in West Yorkshire\" was thrilled when the Beatles came to Bradford to kick off their autumn 1964 UK tour, said Gail Moss.Gail, who was 14 at the time, had more reason to be excited than most.It was around 23:00 GMT on the night of the band's Friday 9 October show when George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr arrived at her Halifax home.The Fab Four - who by then had three albums and five No 1 hits behind them - needed somewhere private to stay to avoid being trailed by adoring fans after performing at Bradford's Gaumont Cinema.Gail's father, Freddie Pearson, knew an associate of Beatles manager Brian Epstein and had offered up the family's Jacobean manor house, where he had opened a private members' club the previous year.Her mother Rita feared their garden would be \"trampled by thousands of screaming fans\" but, thanks to police roadblocks, the band were able to slip from the venue and reach Holdsworth House in secrecy.After arriving, the band chatted to guests at the bar before eating a dinner of trout, turtle soup, cold duckling and steak tartare - a \"rather rich selection\", said Gail - in an upstairs room.Then they returned to the bar, where Harrison, McCartney, Starr and Epstein drank until the early hours of the morning.Lennon, who was celebrating his 24th birthday, retreated to bed early with toothache - but not before causing great amusement with jokes including an imitation of a pompous Yorkshire mill owner.The band's stay meant that Gail and her sister Kim, then eight, had to vacate their bedroom for the night.\"John and Ringo slept in our room and then Paul and George slept in my parents' room and we all shared the bathroom along the corridor,\" Gail told BBC Radio Leeds.Gail got up at at 06:00 the next morning, desperate to meet the band before they left. She need not have been so keen.\"They didn't come down for breakfast on the Saturday morning and at 11 o'clock they were still in their rooms,\" Gail recalled.\"I was in tears, I said 'I'll never meet them'. And my mother sort of knocked on the door and said my daughter's waiting here to see you.\"Gail said she was \"mortified\" to be thrust in front of her heroes by her mother but the band were \"absolutely charming\".She recalled how her sister shyly hid behind a curtain and \"Ringo went to find her and bring her out\" and \"was very sweet with her\".McCartney, meanwhile, offered Gail a cigarette \"which I didn't take and which I could probably have sold for a lot of money\", she added.The brass beds which Starr and Lennon slept on still remain at Holdsworth House - which is now a hotel - along other other mementos of the Beatles' visit.They include a signed menu and the band's \u00c2\u00a32 15s bar bill - on which the head waiter had written their name as \"Beetles\".The Fab Four's visit also left Gail with quite a story.She laughed: \"When I went back to school on Monday they were all furious with me because I hadn't told them.\"Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.
