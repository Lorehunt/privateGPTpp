        "article": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has described allegations that a Conservative MP committed multiple rapes as \"very serious\".He urged anyone with evidence of criminal acts to go to the police.It comes after reports that former Tory Party chairman Sir Jake Berry wrote to police to make them aware of the claims after leaving the post last year.Labour and the Lib Dems have called for an investigation by the party into how it handled the accusations.Sir Jake told police a failure of some individuals to act allowed the alleged perpetrator to \"continue to offend\", the Mail on Sunday reported.Mr Sunak said the Conservative Party had \"robust independent complaint procedures in place\".During a visit to Bacton Gas Terminal in Norfolk, the prime minister was asked whether the rape allegations had been covered up and whether he was investigating the issue.He told broadcasters: \"These are very serious, anonymous allegations.\"It may be that they allude to something that is already the subject of a live police investigation, so I hope you understand it wouldn't be right for me to comment on that further specifically.\"More broadly the Conservative Party has robust independent complaint procedures in place, but I would say to anybody who has information or evidence about any criminal acts to of course talk to the police, that's the right course of action.\"On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who was previously party chairman between September 2021 and June 2022, denied the party had covered up allegations.However, he said he could not comment on the specific case as he did not know the identity of the unnamed MP.Sir Jake, the MP for Rossendale and Darwen, was chairman of the Tory Party during Liz Truss's 49-day premiership last year.According to the Mail on Sunday, he became aware of a series of allegations against an MP - referred to as X - when he was appointed to the role in September 2022.The newspaper said that after leaving the post the following month, he wrote to police with former Chief Whip Wendy Morton to express his concerns about how the party had handled the claims.According to extracts of the letter published by the newspaper, he said the matter had been going on for more than two years, adding: \"The failure of others to act has enabled X to continue to offend.\"A published extract reads: \"There may have been five victims of X - who have been subject to a range of offences including multiple rapes.\"It also claims one unnamed individual was receiving ongoing support at the expense of the Conservative Party.Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said the case was \"horrific\".She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour political parties needed transparent processes in place for when individuals made complaints, with alleged victims supported to go to the police.\"My sense is one of horror and despair that still we haven't got in place a mechanism that will support victims, that will make sure that individuals who are accused of horrific acts are not still free to wonder around Parliament, free to meet with their constituents in constituency surgeries,\" she said.Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were \"deeply concerning\" and needed to be \"thoroughly investigated by the Conservative Party\".Also calling for an investigation, Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said the reports were \"deeply disturbing\".\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "summary": " Based on the provided text, it appears that Barbra Streisand is a successful singer and actress who has been in the entertainment industry for many years. She has had a long and storied career, with numerous hit songs and films to her name. However, she has also faced challenges and discrimination throughout her career, particularly as a woman in a male-dominated industry. Despite these challenges, Streisand remains determined and focused on her work, and is known for being persistent and courageous in the face of adversity.\n\n",
        "article": "When Barbra Streisand was 17 years old and living away from home for the first time, she set herself a goal.\"I have to become famous,\" she told herself, \"just so I can get someone else to make my bed.\"\"I could never figure out those corners,\" laughs the star, reminded of that youthful ambition.\"But, you know, it was more exciting to dream about being famous than the reality. I'm a very private person. I don't enjoy stardom.\"It's a lesson she learned early. When she first came to the UK in 1966, Newsweek magazine had this to say about her.\"Barbra Streisand represents a triumph of aura over appearance... Her nose is too long, her bosom too small, her hips too wide. Yet when she steps in front of a microphone she transcends generations and cultures.\"The media had an odd fixation on her appearance from the outset. She was called an \"amiable anteater\" with an \"unbelievable nose\", who resembled \"a myopic gazelle\".This video can not be playedWatch: Barbra Streisand explains how she got Siri to pronounce her name correctlyIt was only when she became a superstar that the focus changed. Suddenly, Streisand was a \"Babylonian queen\" whose profiles were laced with superlatives - 250 million records sold, 10 Golden Globe awards, five Emmys and two Oscars, for acting and songwriting.But the damage was already done.\"Even after all these years, I'm still hurt by the insults and can't quite believe the praise,\" writes the star in her new autobiography, My Name Is Barbra.The book, she says, is her attempt to correct the record.\"It was the only way to have some control over my life,\" she says.\"This is my legacy. I wrote my story. I don't have to do any more interviews after this.\"Thankfully, she's granted one last interview to the BBC from the comfort of her clifftop home in Malibu. Despite a reputation for running late, she turns up on time - even after a last-minute scramble to find her glasses.She's everything you could hope for: Candid, funny, approachable, slightly pampered, hugely charismatic and occasionally prone to bonkers tangents.\"I feel for flowers just like I feel for ants,\" she declares at one point. \"I can't even crush them.\"Streisand's memoir has been almost 25 years in the making. She started making notes - writing longhand, in pencil - in 1999. The finished manuscript is almost 1,000 pages long and heavy enough to be used as a weapon.The star claims her \"memory is fickle\" but the book is crammed with delicious details of backstage arguments, bewildered suitors and at least one incident of falling off a London bus.She talks about cloning her favourite dog, and signing into hotels as \"Angelina Scarangella\"; then reveals that her marriage to James Brolin was the inspiration for Aerosmith's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing.Meanwhile, her encyclopaedic recall of every meal she's ever eaten will leave you ravenous. The book lists mouth-watering menus of molten chocolate cake, New York pizza slices, soft-shell crabs, honeydew melon, turkey sandwiches with Branston Pickle and (her favourite) Brazilian coffee ice cream.\"I've loved food ever since I was a kid and lived in the projects,\" she admits. \"We had a tiny kitchen and I would love to bake white cupcakes and put on dark chocolate icing.\"Streisand grew up in Brooklyn, and one of her earliest memories is singing in the stairwells of her apartment block.\"I was only five or six years old, and my little girl friends and I used to sing together in the lobby. The acoustics were like a built-in echo. It was a great sound.\"But home life was hard. Her father Emmanuel died of a cerebral haemorrhage when Streisand was 15 months old, leaving the family in poverty. As a child, she turned a hot water bottle into her doll, hugging it at night as she fell asleep.When her mother remarried a couple of years later, things didn't improve. Streisand's new step-father, a used car salesman, was distant and cruel.\"I don't remember ever him talking to me or asking me any questions... How am I? How is school? Anything,\" she says.\"I was never seen by him - or by my mother, either. She didn't see my passion for wanting to be an actress. She discouraged me.\"Years later, her friend and lyricist Marilyn Bergman suggested those early experiences steered Streisand towards the spotlight.\"If you don't have a source of unconditional love as a child, you will probably try to attain that for the rest of your life,\" she told her.\"That was a brilliant analysis,\" reflects Streisand. \"Very eye-opening.\"Leaving home at 16, she took a job as a clerk, while working weekend shifts as a theatre usher, so she could keep up with Broadway's latest shows.\"I got paid $4.50, I think it was, but I always hid my face because I thought someday I'd be well-known,\" she says.\"Isn't that funny? I didn't want people to recognise me on the screen and know that I once showed them to their seats.\"The dream started to come true in 1960, when Streisand entered a talent contest at a Manhattan gay bar. The prize was $50 and a free dinner - and Streisand needed both.She opened her set with the Broadway standard A Sleepin' Bee. When she finished, there was a stunned silence, followed by rapturous applause. That night, the girlfriend of comedian Tiger Haynes told her: \"Little girl, I see dollar signs all over you.\"She was right. Streisand was booked to play shows all around Greenwich, attracting celebrities, record labels and theatrical impresarios. One of them, Arthur Laurents, hired her for a small comedic role in the play I Can Get It For You Wholesale.At the premiere, Streisand turned her single number into a standing ovation that reportedly lasted five minutes - but it was her next role that made her a sensation.Funny Girl, loosely based on the story of vaudeville comedian Fanny Brice, was a once-in-a-lifetime marriage of actress and material.Brice, like Streisand, was a young, Jewish woman who became a star through a combination of determination and hard work; who succeeded because of her differences, not in spite of them.Blessed with songs like People and Don't Rain On My Parade, the show earned rave reviews and eight Tony Award nominations, But Streisand couldn't enjoy the success because her co-star Sydney Chaplin (son of movie star Charlie) was constantly trying to sabotage her performance.\"I don't like to even talk about it,\" she says, shaking her head at the memory.\"It's just a person who had a crush on me - which was unusual - and when I said to him, 'I don't want to be involved with you', he turned on me in such a way that was very cruel.\"He started muttering under his breath while I was talking on stage. Terrible words. Curse words. And he wouldn't look into my eyes anymore. And you know, when you're acting, it's really important to look at the other person, and react to them.\"It threw me. Sometimes I thought, 'What the hell is the next word?' I felt so flustered.\"The experience contributed to the stage fright that stopped Streisand playing concerts for 27 years. But even when she quit live performance, male collaborators proved problematic.Walter Matthau humiliated her on the set of Hello, Dolly, screaming: \"I have more talent in my farts than you have in your whole body\"; while Oscar-winner Frank Pierson publicly trashed the 1976 version of A Star Is Born - which he directed - calling Streisand a control freak who constantly demanded more close-ups.The men who weren't threatened by her confidence were entranced by it. Omar Sharif wrote long, passionate letters begging her to leave her husband; King Charles described her as \"devastatingly attractive\" with \"great sex appeal\"; while Marlon Brando introduced himself by kissing the back of her neck.\"You can't have a back like that and not have it kissed,\" he tells her.\"I think my heart stopped for a moment,\" she recalls in the book. \"What a line!\"In the 1960s and 70s, Streisand was unstoppable. As well as her movie musicals, she played screwball heroines in What's Up, Doc and The Owl And The Pussycat, and the romantic lead in the hugely successful The Way We Were. In a parallel recording career, she scored hits like Woman In Love, Evergreen and No More Tears (Enough Is Enough), becoming the second biggest-selling female artist of all time.She made her directorial debut with 1983's Yentl - the first Hollywood movie where a woman was the writer, producer, director and star.The story of an orthodox Jewish woman who disguises herself as a boy to study the Talmud, it was an allegory for sexual equality - making it all the more ironic when Streisand was paid nothing for the script, given minimum wage for directing, and forced to halve her acting fee.But when she came to England for the film shoot, the sexism melted away.\"You had a Queen and Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister,\" she says. \"In other words, you weren't intimidated by me being a woman.\"In America, I sadly tell you, it was so different. The people were cold, aloof.\"In print, Streisand takes the opportunity to settle those old scores and dispel the \"diva\" myth that surrounds her. She acquits herself well, telling a story of persistence and courage that's laced with dry self-awareness and humour.But she still has moments of star behaviour - such as the time she phoned up Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain that the iPhone was pronouncing her name wrong.\"My name isn't spelled with a 'Z',\" she protests. \"It's Strei-sand, like sand on the beach. How simple can you get?\"\"And Tim Cook was so lovely. He had Siri change the pronunciation... I guess that's one perk of fame!\"Now 81 years old, she suggests that the memoir is a full stop on her career. The film projects she pursued for the last decade - a biopic of photographer Margaret Bourke-White, and a movie of the musical Gypsy - have both fallen through.Instead, she envisions spending more time at home.\"I want to live life,\" she says. \"I want to get in my husband's truck and just wander, hopefully with the children somewhere near us.\"Life is fun for me when they come over. They love playing with the dogs and we have fun.\"I haven't had much fun in my life, to tell you the truth. And I want to have more fun.\"Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "summary": " The article is about a rare astronomical phenomenon called \"Steve\" that was observed across the UK on Sunday night, which is not an aurora but is often associated with its better-known cousin, the aurora borealis or Northern Lights.

        "article": "A message to everyone called Steve - your name was quite literally up in lights on Sunday night.Steve is shy and rarely appears in the skies of the UK - there were reported sightings back in March and in the Shetland Islands in 2021.But Steve has returned, this time illuminating the skies over the north-east of England and Scotland.The thin, purple ribbon, which was seen glowing in the sky in Northumberland, County Durham and Argyll, is a relatively new scientific discovery.Steve is not an aurora but is often associated with its better known cousin, the aurora borealis - or Northern Lights - which was also captured across parts of the UK on Sunday.The much rarer Steve has appeared in the pictures BBC Weather were sent from their Weather Watchers.It has been photographed for decades but only got the name Steve in 2016, following a US citizen science project funded by Nasa and the National Science Foundation.The inspiration behind the glow's name is thought to be a scene from the animated movie \"Over the Hedge\".In it, a group of animals awake from hibernation to find what to them is another awe-inspiring phenomenon - a big garden hedge.\"What is this thing?\" one creature says.\"I'd be a lot less afraid of it if I just knew what it was called,\" another says, before a squirrel recommends calling it Steve.\"I'm a lot less scared of Steve,\" another animal replies.Scientists later adapted the name into an acronym - \"Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement\".And it's not just sky-watchers who have shown an interest in Steve.In 2019, the Canadian government minted a collector's coin worth $20 featuring the mysterious streaks of light.Little was known about its formation and why it can sometimes appear during an aurora display.Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center has been studying Steve using pictures from the ground along with satellites.While auroras happen globally in an oval shape, Steve appears as a ribbon and lasts for 20 minutes to an hour before disappearing.While Steve is only spotted in the presence of an aurora, it is not a normal aurora as scientists suggests it comprises of a fast-moving stream of extremely hot particles called a subauroral ion drift, or SAID.As Steve is unpredictable and only lasts for a short time, recording occurrences from the ground is rare.The phenomenon has been reported from the UK, Canada, northern US states and New Zealand, according to Nasa.The aurora borealis was spotted right across the UK on Sunday night.Aurora watchers were alerted to a geomagnetic storm in the evening after a strong solar wind sent charged particles towards Earth.These charged particles follow the magnetic pull into the North Pole and interacted with oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere to create the greens, purples and reds associated with the Northern Lights.While normally just seen at high latitudes such as Scotland, it was so strong it was captured on camera right across the UK.This video can not be playedWatch: UK skies lit up by stunning Northern Lights show\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

        "summary": " The article discusses how British Steel has announced plans to convert its blast furnaces into electric arc furnaces by 2025, which will make steel production more environmentally friendly and reduce carbon emissions. However, unions have expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs due to the shift towards electric arc furnaces. The article also mentions that Tata Steel has similar plans, which could lead to the UK being unable to produce steel from raw materials and exposed to international markets.",
        "article": "British Steel has confirmed it plans to close down its blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, putting up to 2,000 jobs at risk.They will be replaced with two electric arc furnaces - one at Scunthorpe and one at Teesside.The company said its \u00c2\u00a31.25bn proposal would make British Steel \"a clean, green and sustainable business\".But it said the plans were still \"subject to appropriate support\" from the UK government.The business, which is owned by China's Jingye Group, said the new furnaces could be in operation by late 2025.Chief executive Xijun Cao said the firm was not able to keep the blast furnaces and meet environmental commitments.\"We have engaged extensively with the public and private sector to understand the feasibility of producing net zero steel with our current blast furnace operations. However, thorough analysis shows this is not viable,\" he said.Unions estimate the shift could ultimately lead to the loss of 1,500 to 2,000 jobs, predominantly at Scunthorpe.British Steel said it was working with North Lincolnshire Council on \"a masterplan\" to attract new business and jobs to the site in Scunthorpe, parts of which would become vacant under the proposals.The Department for Business and Trade said the proposals were part of a plan to put the UK steel industry on a greener, more sustainable footing for the future.A spokesperson said the government had offered \"a generous support package including more than \u00c2\u00a3300m of investment\".Earlier this year, British Steel's larger rival, Tata, announced it would close its two blast furnaces in Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc furnaces, with an expected loss of up to 3,000 jobs. It will receive \u00c2\u00a3500m of government support.British Steel said it remained in talks with the government over what backing it could expect for its strategy.\"We need the UK to adopt the correct policies and frameworks now to back our decarbonisation drive,\" said Xijun Cao.Governments in other countries had adopted such policies and waiting for the same in the UK could impact the firm's competitiveness and the UK's ability to meet its carbon targets, he said.Government sources claim that the blast furnace plants are not economic - they are losing \u00c2\u00a31m a day, they say - and are not \"green\", therefore making them unsustainable on financial and environmental grounds.The government conceded that the plan to close the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe and Port Talbot will leave the UK without the ability to make \"virgin steel\".But it insisted that there were limited domestic cases where that kind of steel was needed, and that the output from electric arc furnaces covered most of the UK's needs.Coke-fuelled blast furnaces reach a higher temperature and can smelt iron ore directly to create steel. But they emit more greenhouse gases and require greater manpower.Electric arc furnaces are mostly used to melt down and repurpose scrap steel. The end product is not the same grade of steel that is produced in blast furnaces, and is not suitable for all industrial uses in, for example, motor manufacturing and construction.However, because they run at lower temperatures, arc furnaces can be powered by renewable energy sources. They can produce stainless and alloyed steels.Unions expressed concern at the timescale of the migration and said they would examine British Steel's proposals in detail.Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community, the specialist trade union representing UK steelworkers, said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the plans to switch to only electric arc furnaces, which he described as \"dangerous and foolhardy\".\"The plans that British Steel has announced, combined with Tata Steel's plans, would leave the UK unable to make steel from raw materials and dangerously exposed to international markets,\" he said.Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, warned: \"Workers won't stand back and watch as Britain's steel industry is dismantled in real time.\"Unions have already threatened industrial action over Tata's plans.\"The Conservatives are presenting a false choice,\" he said. \"Other countries have shown that it is possible to transition to zero-carbon steelmaking and protect good steelmaking jobs for the future. We can do the same here.\"Charlotte Brumpton-Childs from the GMB union said the closure would be \"a hammer blow\" for UK steel and \"devastating\" for the people of Scunthorpe.The towers and chimneys of the steelworks have been part of the Lincolnshire town's landscape for more than five decades, employing generations of local workers.But the UK's second largest steel manufacturer collapsed in 2019, then was bought by Jingye, with promises to invest more than a \u00c2\u00a31bn over 10 years.A British Steel spokesperson said the company was committed to \"providing long-term, skilled and well-paid careers for thousands of employees and many more in our supply chains\".The firm announced in February that it was closing its coking oven, used to turn coal into fuel for the blast furnaces. At the time it said steelmaking in the UK was \"uncompetitive\" with some of the highest energy, carbon and labour costs in the world.How are you affected by the issues raised in this story?
